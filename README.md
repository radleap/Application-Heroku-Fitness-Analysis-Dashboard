## Project: Fitbit Fitness Dashboard Application

## Build Status: 
   In development, early phases of machine learning workflow. Conda environment "env_fitness" in use, requirements.txt to be provided later. 

## General Details

The application will makes use of Heroku, an open source PaaS, with a Bootstrap framework. The CSS and HTML was customized for simplicity, but maintain the connectivity between the various components. This is our scaffolding, with all documents maintained on Github.
The dashboard will make use of Plotly or a similar visualization package. 
It is possible some machine learning will be used, but this is in the early stages of Retrieving data, cleaning/exploring, and preparing/transforming. (At this point, there is not an active goal for prediction.) 

## Motivation
   Review fitness data over last year, build a dashboard, see lifestely patterns, and implement old/new learnings.
